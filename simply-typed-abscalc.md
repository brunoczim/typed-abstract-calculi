The syntax of terms is the same as in the original [abstract calculus](https://github.com/MaiaVictor/abstract-calculus).
Reduction rules are the same as in the original ac.
As in the original ac, variables can only be used once and are global.

Work in progress

# Syntax

```haskell
type ::=
    | A                                        -- constant
    | type → type                              -- function
    | (type, type)                             -- pair

expression ::=
    | x                                        -- variable
    | λx. expression                           -- abstraction, lambda
    | expression expression                    -- application
    | (expression, expression)                 -- superposition, pair
    | let (p, q) = expression in expression    -- definition, let
    | ...                                      -- -- additional terms associated with type constants
                                               --      (such as integer literals associated with `Int`)


```
